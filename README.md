LEV, short for Local de Ensino Virtual, is a project aiming to build virtual learning zone for lusophone schools.
The files in this repository are the initial ones and they reflect pretty much what I have lerant so far in my ZTM Web Developer course.
Hopefully, by the end of this learning process the environment will look and function more the way is intended to.

Any future ideas on how to make it more functional will be welcome.

I hope you enjoy browsing on here.
